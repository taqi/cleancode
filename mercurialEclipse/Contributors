Bastian Doetsch -
	I'm interested in Mercurial and MercurialEclipse so I started contributing a bit while learning.
	I try to get the synchronize infrastructure to work.
	Zingos Comment: Well Bastian seem to learn fast :) the Time from the first small patch to large

Ismael Juma -
	I'm interested in moving from SVN to Mercurial at work and good Eclipse support is important.
	While testing the plugin I ran into some issues and decided to contribute.

Andrei Loskutov:
	I've started to use hg because I was shocked that SVN can't propagate changes to renamed/moved files.
	Because I'm Eclipse guy, I've started to use MercurialEclipse. To make my life
	easier I've started to fix the issues I found in the plugin.
	More info about me might be found at http://andrei.gmxhome.de

Adam Berkes & Zsolt Koppany - Intland Software - http://www.intland.com
	Because of well known limitations of Subversion we moved from Subversion to Mercurial.

	We at Intland Software are very happy with Mercurial and our goal is to enhance and extend this
	free and open source plugin for enterprise environment.

Philip Graf:
	Implemented proxy support for remote operations.
	
Bjoern Stachmann:
	Actually i'm more of a git type. But then i'm an eclipse type too.
	Have you tried EGit? I did. Then i stumbled upon upon this nice
	piece of plugin here. Trying it i found that using mercurial isn't 
	that bad ;-) But it did miss some features so i started to contribute. 

John Peberdy:
	Improved the synchronize view and conflicted rebase and other usability improvements.
